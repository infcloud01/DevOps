group
=====
Manage groups. On most platforms this can only create groups.
Group membership must be managed on individual users.
On some platforms such as OS X, group membership is managed as an
attribute of the group, not the user record. Providers must have
the feature 'manages_members' to manage the 'members' property of
a group record.


Parameters
----------

- **allowdupe**
    Whether to allow duplicate GIDs. Defaults to `false`.
    Valid values are `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`. 

- **attribute_membership**
    Whether specified attribute value pairs should be treated as the only
    attributes
    of the user or whether they should merely
    be treated as the minimum list.
    Valid values are `inclusive`, `minimum`. 

- **attributes**
    Specify group AIX attributes in an array of `key=value` pairs.
    Requires features manages_aix_lam.

- **auth_membership**
    Whether the provider is authoritative for group membership. This
    must be set to true to allow setting the group to no members with
    `members => [],`.
Valid values are `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`. 

- **ensure**
    Create or remove the group.
Valid values are `present`, `absent`. 

- **forcelocal**
    Forces the management of local accounts when accounts are also
    being managed by some other NSS
    Valid values are `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`. 
    Requires features libuser.

- **gid**
    The group ID.  Must be specified numerically.  If no group ID is
    specified when creating a new group, then one will be chosen
    automatically according to local system standards. This will likely
    result in the same group having different GIDs on different systems,
    which is not recommended.
    On Windows, this property is read-only and will return the group's
    security
identifier (SID).

- **ia_load_module**
    The name of the I&A module to use to manage this user
    Requires features manages_aix_lam.

- **members**
    The members of the group. For directory services where group
    membership is stored in the group objects, not the users. Use
    with auth_membership to determine whether the specified members
    are inclusive or the minimum.
Requires features manages_members.

- **name**
    The group name. While naming limitations vary by operating system,
    it is advisable to restrict names to the lowest common denominator,
    which is a maximum of 8 characters beginning with a letter.
    Note that Puppet considers group names to be case-sensitive, regardless
    of the platform's own rules; be sure to always use the same case when
    referring to a given group.

- **system**
    Whether the group is a system group with lower GID.
    Valid values are `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`.
