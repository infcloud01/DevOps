    # and requesting data from an ENC. (This can be changed with the `node_name_value`

    # A comma-separated list of alternate DNS names for Puppet Server. These are extra

    # certificate with `puppet cert generate`.
    # 
    # In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like
    # "puppet.example.com"), Puppet Server needs a certificate that proves it's

    # its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it. If you use a single
    # hostname for Puppet traffic but load-balance it to multiple Puppet Servers, each
    # of those servers needs to include the official hostname in its list of extra
    # names.
    # 
    # **Note:** The list of alternate names is locked in when the server's
    # certificate is signed. If you need to change the list later, you can't just
    # change this setting; you also need to:
    # 
    # * On the server: Stop Puppet Server.
    # * On the CA server: Revoke and clean the server's old certificate. (`puppet cert clean <NAME>`)
    # * On the server: Delete the old certificate (and any old certificate signing requests)
    #   from the [ssldir](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_ssldir.html).
    # * On the server: Run `puppet agent -t --ca_server <CA HOSTNAME>` to request a new certificate

    #   (`puppet cert sign --allow-dns-alt-names <NAME>`).
    # * On the server: Run `puppet agent -t --ca_server <CA HOSTNAME>` to retrieve the cert.
    # * On the server: Start Puppet Server again.

    # An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing

    # certificates created with the `puppet cert generate` command.
    # 
    # If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a `custom_attributes` key

    # Whether to apply catalogs in noop mode, which allows Puppet to
    # partially simulate a normal run. This setting affects puppet agent and

    # 
    # When running in noop mode, Puppet will check whether each resource is in sync,
    # like it does when running normally. However, if a resource attribute is not in
    # the desired state (as declared in the catalog), Puppet will take no
    # action, and will instead report the changes it _would_ have made. These
    # simulated changes will appear in the report sent to the puppet master, or
    # be shown on the console if running puppet agent or puppet apply in the
    # foreground. The simulated changes will not send refresh events to any
    # subscribing or notified resources, although Puppet will log that a refresh
    # event _would_ have been sent.
    # 
    # **Important note:**
    # [The `noop` metaparameter](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/metaparameter.html#noop)
    # allows you to apply individual resources in noop mode, and will override
    # the global value of the `noop` setting. This means a resource with
    # `noop => false` _will_ be changed if necessary, even when running puppet
    # agent with `noop = true` or `--noop`. (Conversely, a resource with
    # `noop => true` will only be simulated, even when noop mode is globally disabled.)

    # How unrelated resources should be ordered when applying a catalog.
    # Allowed values are `title-hash`, `manifest`, and `random`. This

    # * `manifest` (the default) will use the order in which the resources were

    #   value if you're migrating from 3.x and have errors running with
    #   `manifest`.
    # * `random` will order resources randomly and change their order with each
    #   run. This can work like a fuzzer for shaking out undeclared dependencies.
    # 
    # Regardless of this setting's value, Puppet will always obey explicit
